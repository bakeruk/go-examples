## Getting started

Ensure you have Go installed.

Run the files using `go run <file_path>`.

## Hello world

`hello-world` is a simple "Hello world" example, demonstrating Go's syntax and concurrency via its async/await equivalent, channels.

## Hello world (intermediate)

`hello-world-intermediate` is an intermediate "Hello world" example, demonstrating Go's syntax and concurrency via its async/await equivalent, channels.

## Random integer range
